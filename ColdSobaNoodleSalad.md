## Ingredients

- 6.2 oz Buckwheat Noodles (2/3 of a pack)
- 2 cup Red Cabbage, thinly shredded
- 1 1/2 cup Carrot, grated
- 1 2/3 cup Cucumber, thinly sliced
- 1/2 cup Cilantro, chopped
- Sesame Seeds, to sprinkle on top (optional)

### For the Peanut Sauce
- 1/2 cup Natural Peanut Butter (should be runny)
- Juice of 1 Lime
- 1 tbsp Tamari (or Soy Sauce, Liquid Aminos)
- 2 cloves Garlic, minced
- 1/2 tbsp Ginger, grated (about 1/2â€³ knob)
- 1/2 tsp Brown Sugar
- 2-4 tbsp Filtered Water

## Instructions
1. Rinse and prep all veggies.
2. In a small bowl, prepare the Peanut Sauce. Combine all ingredients and stir until an even dressing forms. Begin with 2 tbsp of water, then add water in 1 tbsp increments until the sauce reaches your desired consistency, as necessary.
3. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook your Soba Noodles according to package instructions; mine required only 4 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water.
4. Add the Cabbage, Carrot, Cucumber, and Cilantro to a large bowl. Pour the Peanut Sauce over the veggies and mix well. Then, gently fold in the rinsed Soba Noodles until everything is well distributed.
5. Garnish with Sesame Seeds and serve immediately, or store in the fridge in an airtight container for up to 5 days.

## Ingredients

### For the Homemade Noodles (Optional):
- 2 cups (300g) All-Purpose Flour, plus more for dusting
- 1/2 tsp Salt
- 1 tbsp Neutral Oil
- 2/3 cup (140 ml) Filtered Water

### For the Sesame Sauce:
- 2 tbsp Tahini or Sesame Paste
- 4 tbsp Smooth Peanut Butter
- 2-3 tbsp Light Soy Sauce (to taste)
- 1 tsp Unseasoned Rice Vinegar
- 2-3 tsp Sugar
- 1/2 cup Hot Water
- 2 tsp Toasted Sesame Oil

### To Garnish the Noodles:
- Toasted Sesame Seeds
- Chopped Peanuts
- Seedless Cucumber, sliced
- Fresh Cilantro
- Green Onions
- Chili Oil, to taste

## Instructions

### For the Homemade Noodles (Optional):
1. First, whisk the **flour** and **salt** together in a large bowl. Add the **oil** at the center of the bowl, and use chopsticks to mix well.
2. Slowly add the **water** to the flour mixture a little at a time, using the chopsticks to mix everything together. Once you can no longer mix the dough with the chopsticks, use your hands to knead the dough and form a ball. It may look slightly lumpy, but that's okay!
3. Return the dough ball to the bowl and cover with a damp tea towel; let rest for 20 minutes. The dough will not rise, but will become more elastic and easier to work with.
4. Divide the dough into 2-4 portions, to make it easier to work with. Flour your surface and use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a thin sheet (about 1 cm thick). Dust the sheet with more flour, flip it, then dust again.
5. Re-flour your surface, then fold the dough sheet into 3-4 layers. Cut the dough into thin stips (~1 cm) to create the noodles, unfolding the dough to reveal the noodle. Let the noodles rest for another 15 minutes before gently "pulling" the noodles (by holding the ends and "bouncing" them on your floured surface) to stretch them out. This step is optional, but fun!
6. Dust the noodles with even more flour to prevent sticking, then bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the noodles for 3-5 minutes, until tender. You may have to do this in batches, depending on how large your pot is. Serve the noodles immediately - they're best when hot!

### For the Sesame Sauce:
1. Add all of the ingredients except for the hot water to a medium bowl and mix well. Slowly whisk the hot water into the sauce, then taste and add any extra ingredients according to your personal preference. Refrigerate any Sauce leftovers for up to one week.

### To Assemble the Bowls:
1. Cook your desired Noodles according to the package instructions, if you are not making them from scratch.
2. Add the Noodles to a bowl, then toss them with the Sesame Sauce. Top with Cucumber, Green Onion, Cilantro, Toasted Sesame Seeds, Chopped Peanuts, and a hefty drizzle of Chili Oil to finish things off! Serve warm and enjoy.
